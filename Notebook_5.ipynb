    "        <li>Any <em>categorical</em> feature can be (and must be) turned into numerical values.</li>\n",
    "        <li> Also, new features can be created by combining other ones</li>\n",
    "        <li>A model can be used to perform classification or regression depending on whether the target is categorical (or binary as we saw it) or continuous (as it was the case in the third notebook)</li>\n",

    "    The <em>parameters</em> of a such model are the rules of each node, and the <em>shape</em> of the tree. To classify a sample, the model will simply make it flow through each node until it reaches a leaf.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    The learning process works by fiding <em>optimal</em> cuts. A cut is a split over a feature depending on a certain value : <code>price_first_item_purchased</code> > 125\\$ for exemple is a cut.\n",
    "    <br >\n",
    "    To find those cuts, the algorithm uses a mesure called the <em>Gini impurty</em> : it represents the probability of miss-classifying a sample based on a certain cut. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning\">CART</a> algorithm aims the lowest impurty when building nodes. It looks for <em>purety</em> when performing splits. The model will always try to find the most discriminative characteristics over the features with regards to the target.The training process ends when the classification score is above a minimal threshold, or when the tree contains a certain amount of node, or reaches a maximal height.\n",

The simpliest way of improving the score of a tree is to make it more complex, more <em>convoluted</em>. This produces <em>overfitted</em> models and all explainability is lost. The tree becames over specialized in predicting on the test set and creates ultra-specific rules (you can observe this by re-training a more complex tree on the cells above and draw it). To avoid this, a <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> will train multiple simple trees over small subsets of the train set. This way, we avoid overfitting and we keep the single models simple.
